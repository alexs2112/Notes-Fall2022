### The Roman Emperor
 - This poem is an attack on the emperor Domitian
 - Would torture and put people in jail who mocked his lack of hair
	 - His official statue had hair added to it
 - Ridicules the emperor and his court in a mock-epic tale of a fish so prodigious that it was fit for the emperor alone
 - Council of state is called to deal with crisis of how to cook it
	 - Fish can't be cooked by conventional means due to its size, nor can it be cut into pieces
 - Main themes are corruption, incompetence of sycophantic courtiers, unwillingness/inability to speak truth to power

### Satire 4
 - Intro: Corrupt Crispinus buys a 60-pound mullet for 60 gold pieces
	 - Crispinus isn't described very well, kind of a POS
 - Reminded of historical referent: A giant turbot caught at Ancona, too big for anyone else to eat, needs to be given to the emperor as he is the most important person
	 - A little far from Rome, need to preserve it through the mountains
 - Fish presented to the emperor Domitian
 - Imperial councilors Pegasus and Crispus ponder the problem
 - Acilius comes next and his condemned son
 - Five more councilors (Rubrius, Montanus, Fuscus, Veiento, Catullus)
	 - These were all real councilors, important people
	 - Argue about how to cook the fish
		 - Would be an insult to cut it up, need to cook it whole
 - Montanus suggests that a casserole large enough to cook the fish needs to be bought
	 - Need the best potter in rome to create the biggest cooking pot known to rome
 - The council breaks up, narrator voices his wish that all the actions of Dominitian had been so meaningless
