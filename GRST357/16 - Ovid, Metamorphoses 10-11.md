	 - Accidentally killed with his hunting javelin as it lay sleeping
 - Cyparissus is so grief-stricken he asks Apollo to let his tears fall forever
 - God turns the boy into a cypress tree, whos sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk
 - Cypress tree became a symbol of mourning

### Song 2: Ganymede

 - Had been tending sheep
	 - Rustic or humble pursuit characteristic of a hero's boyhood before his privileged status is revealed
 - Zeus either summoned an eagle or turned himself into an eagle himself to transport the youth to Mount Olympus
 - On Olympus, Zeus had him granted eternal youth and immortality and the office of cupbearer to the gods
	- In lace of his daughter Hebe who was relieved of her duties as cupbearer upon her marriage to Hercules

### Song 3: Hyacinthus
 - A mortal Apollo loved
 - Favourite activities together were hunting and sports
 - Tried to decide who could throw a discus further
 - Apollo went first, threw the discus an incredible distance
 - Hyacinthus ran after it, was too fast, arrived at the spot where it connected with the ground. It rebounded and hit him in the head, killing him
 - In grief, Apollo turned Hyacinthus into a flower
	 - Wrote the letters "AI" on its petals, a Greek expression of lamentation ("oh woe")

### Song 4: The Propoetides of Amathus
 - Orpheus sings about some women called the Propoetides
	 - Came from the city of Amathus on the island of Cyprus
 - Whenever guests came to visit them, Propoetides turned them into human sacrifice
 - Venus, the patron goddess of Cyprus, as punishment, made the Propoetides grow horns
	 - They were not reformed
	 - Propoetides claimed Venus wasn't a goddess at all
	 - Venus, in response, turned them into mythology's first prostitutes
	 - Subsequently, she turned them into stones
 - Not entirely sure why this is part of the book

### Song 5: Pygmalion
 - A Cypriot sculptor who carved a woman out of ivory (a creator, Orpheus, Ovid)
 - According to Ovid, after seeing the Propoetides prostituting themselves, Pygmalion declared that he was "not interested in women"
	 - Found that his statue was so beautiful and realistic that he fell in love iwith it
 - Aphrodite's festival came, he made offerings at the altar of Aphrodite
	 - Too scared to admit his desire, he quietly wished for a bride who would be "the living likeness of my ivory girl"
 - When he returned home he kissed his ivory statue, felt the lips were warm
 - Kissed it again and found the ivor had lost its hardness
 - Married the ivory sculpture which changed to a woman under Aphrodite's blessing
	 - In Ovid's narrative, they had a daughter, Paphos, from whom the city's name is derived
 - In these stories about Pygmalion by Orpheus, Ovid is telling us about the creator (the poet), either Orpheus or himself
	 - It is only in book 10 and the beginning of book 11 that Ovid does this

### Song 6: Myrrha
 - Saddest story in the Metamorphoses
