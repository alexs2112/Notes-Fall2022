### Data Analysis
 - **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Process of gathering evidence, much like detective work
 - **Confirmatory Data Analysis**: Process of evaluating evidence is comparable to a court trial
	 - Testing hypotheses from graphs and charts
 - Understanding data and drawing conclusions, visualizations can help

### Terms
 - **Mean**: Average, useful if the data points are all close to the mean
 - **Variance**: Square the difference of each data point and divide by the number of points
	 - Not super accurate
 - **Standard Deviation**: Take the square root of the variance, makes more sense
