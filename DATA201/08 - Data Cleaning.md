### Dirty Data
 - **Sources of Error**: Data entry, Measurement, Distillation, Data integration
 - **Data Entry**
	 - Human error, most common
	 - Not specific in asking questions (no units asked, etc)
	 - Stupid questions
 - **Measurement**
	 - Inaccurate/differing tools
	 - Inaccurate people
	 - Calibration issues
 - **Distillation**
	 - Rounding errors
	 - Not storing everything that was collected (changing the data, you can't revert the change once data is lost)
	 - Storing the data in confusing ways
 - **Data Integration**
	 - Data comes from multiple sources (might have different formats)
	 - Schemas change over time
