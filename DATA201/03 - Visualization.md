### What is Visualization?
 - Scientific Visualization
 - Information Visualization
 - Data Visualization
 - Interchangeable terms
 - Creating a representation of data

### Visual Language
 - Data, encoded to images and signs, decoded to information
	 - Encoding by design, want it as simple and intuitive as possible
	 - Decoded by viewer
 - Different types of data are best to encode in different ways

### Levels of Measurement
 - **Nominal**: Categorical data and labels
	 - *Example*: Fruits: apples, oranges, bananas, etc
	 - Nothing implied, just the types of fruits
 - **Ordinal**: Categorical data in meaningful order
	 - *Example*: Medals: gold, silver, bronze
 - **Interval**: Degree of difference, arbitrary origin
	 - *Example*: Temperature
 - **Ratio**: Unique (non-arbitrary) origin. Zero indicates the absence of the quantity
	 - *Example*: Length
 - Interval vs Ratio: 0 length is absence of length, 0 temperature means nothing
