All the work for an essay without actually writing an essay

For the first two questions, find 10 points that relate to the question and briefly describe them in 8-10 words. Leave them in point form
 - You won't use all of these for an actual essay, just list them off

**Some motifs for the third question:**
 - Unmarried woman
 - Jealous sister
 - Empty castle
Should try to use a handful of very short quotations (handful of words) from the text.
Don't need a conclusion
