### Igneous Rock Stratigraphy
 - Principle of Inclusions
	 - Layers of igneous rocks with inclusions of older layers
	 - Lavaflow picking up detached inclusions of older rocks before crystallizing
 - Principle of Cross-Cutting Relationships
	 - Long inclusion of a younger rock that cuts through an older igneous segment, forming nearly parallel lines (dikes)
	 - Second(+) generation dikes can cut through the older igneous segment along with the first generation dike, younger than both of them.
 - Relative Age of Lavaflows (and Sills)
	 - Layers of igenous rock are younger than the layers below, as the lava flow was so hot it cooked the younger layers beneath it.
		 - Can also cook layers above it, which means it is younger than both surrounding layers (formed by an intrusive rock, injection, cooking both sides)
	 - Sedimentary layers above the igneous rocks can have inclusions

### Geologic Time Scale
 - Four eons, youngest to oldest
 - **Phanerozoic** (Visible life forms)
	 - Begins with large size fossils, visible without a microscope
	 - Boundary between Phanerozoic and Proterozoic defined by massive event, agronomic revolution leading to massive diversification of the life forms on Earth
		 - Revolution generated by the formation of burrowers
		 - After this process, evolution takes over. Shortly after, evolution of the first global predator (due to large eyes of 360 degree vision)
	 - Consists of many subdivisions (as do the others, cover this one)
 - **Proterozoic** (Early life forms)
	 - Oldest fossils
	 - Longest in the Earth's history
	 - Around the Archean Proterozoic border, the continents began to move around the Asthenosphere (previously it just moved up and down)
		 - Asthenosphere currents started to push the continents around
		 - Modern plate tectonic regime began, first evidence that it started in the Indian Ocean
 - **Archean** (Oldest rocks)
	 - The boundary between Hadean and Archean is highly subjective, depends on the age of the oldest rocks we know (changes when we find older ones)
 - **Hadean** (No rock record)
	 - No more Hadean rocks on Earth
	 - Can't be subdivided, there are no rocks

### Phanerozoic Subdivisions
 - Three Eras, youngest to oldest, read backwards
 - Defined by the resemblance between life forms
 - **Cenozoic**
	 - Boundary marks the most severe crisis in the history of life
		 - Ocean conveyor collapsed, planetary ocean was transformed into a large swamp (no more movement between the layers of water)
		 - Temperature increased very quickly
		 - More than 95% of the species (aquatic and terrestrial) died, great dying
		 - One million years after, the Ocean Conveyor restarted and life recovered
	 - Extinction of the dinosaurs
	 - Eventual evolution of primates to take over
	 - Subdivided into three periods (oldest to youngest)
		 - Paleogene
		 - Neogene
		 - Quaternary
 - **Mesozoic**
	 - Flora and Fauna began to resemble modern life forms
	 - Mammals evolved, practically took over in Cenozoic
	 - Reptiles dominated wetter areas
	 - Life diversification
	 - Continuous planetary ocean driven by a giant "Ocean Conveyor" (one big current)
	 - Current forced all the continents together, Pangaea
	 - Subdivided into three periods (oldest to youngest)
		 - Triassic
		 - Jurassic
		 - Cretaceous
 - **Paleozoic**
	 - Very small resemblances between these fossils and organisms today
	 - Alien looking mfs
	 - Subdivided into seven Periods (oldest to youngest):
		 - Cambrian
			 - Whales
		 - Ordovician
			 - Ancient Welsh tribes
		 - Silurian
			 - Ancient Welsh tribes
		 - Devonian
			 - England, development of layers of rocks
		 - Mississippian
			 - Mississippi
		 - Pennsylvanian
			 - Pennsylvania
			 - These two are only recognized in North America
			 - Otherwise the two are Carboniferous (everywhere minus North America)
		 - Permian
			 - Russian city in the Euro Mountains (Perm)
