### Seneca's Philosophy
 - Stoicism and Epicureanism
 - The Goal: Happiness is best gained by the middle way (bravery, love, self-control). Balancing and controlling your emotions
	 - Justice is procured from living according to this mode as well
```
	EXTREME    BALANCE       EXTREME
	Boldness   Bravery       Cowardice
	Rashness   Bravery       Fear
	Lust       Love          Indifference
	Anger      Self-control  Submission
	Glutton    Self-control  Abstinence
	Tyrant     Free Human    Slave
	Innocence  Guilt         Insensitivity   <- Not stoicism, Oedipus
```

### Medea
 - Wife/ex-wife of Jason
 - Jason leaves Medea for Creusa, daughter of King Creon
	 - Sees advantage in this political marriage
	 - Not being an actual citizen is a massive problem, marries into citizenship
 - Medea refuses to leave peacefully
	 - Sends poisoned robe as gift for Creusa on her wedding day (poisons, snake blood, herbs, invocations to underworld gods). Catches cursed fire, also killing Creon who tries to save her
	 - Sacrifices her children from the roof of her house in order to hurt Jason
	 - Eventually boils Jason to death
 - Jason ends the play by claiming there are no gods, otherwise such acts would not have been committed

### Why does Seneca use Mythology
 - Apuleius and Juvenal wrote about real life and daily life
 - So why myth?
	 - Everybody knows myth, so it speaks to people everywhere
	 - Tends to be more dignified and serious
	 - Normal subject for tragedy in the theater
